## Getting started

### Pre-requisite

You need to have the following installed locally:
- Git (2.41+)
- Node (20.4.0+)

### Setting things up

- Clone the github repo locally
  - `git clone https://github.com/dm-tech-phil/dm-ui.git`
- Change directory and install packages
  - `cd dm-ui`
  - `npm install`

### Running the application

- To start the development server locally run
  - `npx nx serve dm-ui`
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/

## Using GitHub Codespace

If you want to use GitHub Codespace, you don't even need most of the setup part.

- Navigate to: https://github.com/dm-tech-phil/dm-ui
- Select Code (green button top right)
- Select Codespace tab
- Create your Codespace from there

Once your codespace runs, you will have a vscode like page that opens. You can then serve the application running this command in a terminal:
- `npx nx serve dm-ui --host=0.0.0.0`

### Using codespace from local VsCode
If you want to work from a local vscode, you can install the GitHub Codespace extension in VSCode and then start your codespace from the Remote Explorer menu item on the left. Once the codespace is loaded, you can serve by running this command in a terminal:
- `npx nx serve dm-ui --host=0.0.0.0`

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, the above steps can be used, but instead of using the https://github.com/dm-tech-phil/dm-ui.git repo, you should create a fork from there and use this to clone or to create your codespace. Then you will be able to push and create pr from there.
